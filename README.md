This application was created to fulfill the requirements of the test project.

The application uses Hangfire extension to run an automatic update server with exception handling and logging,
it can be accessed from the application's main page by clicking the hangfire dashboard button.
normally the user shouldn't be able to access this page without authentication but since this is a demo authorization is given to the user without the need to login.
